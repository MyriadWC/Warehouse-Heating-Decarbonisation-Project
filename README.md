The <a href="https://github.com/MyriadWC/Warehouse-Heating-Decarbonisation-Project/blob/main/Borehole%20Decarbonisation%20Report.pdf">report</a> for my final year decarbonisation project. The goal was to replace the diesel heating system of a large factory warehouse with a low carbon, low OPEX heat pump system. The project considered both GSHP and ASHP solutions, and it was found that the ASHP solution had a payback period of only a few years. However, the final report only includes the unfeasible GSHP, solar thermal and boreholes solution due to space constraints. Details of the ASHP system can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/MyriadWC/Warehouse-Heating-Decarbonisation-Project/blob/main/Unfinished%20Report%20(Both%20solutions).pdf">second, unfinished report</a> which includes both solutions.
