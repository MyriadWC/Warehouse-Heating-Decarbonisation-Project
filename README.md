The report for my final year decarbonisation project. The goal was to replace the diesel heating system of a large factory warehouse with a low carbon, low OPEX heat pump system. The project considered both GSHP and ASHP solutions, and it was found that the ASHP solution had a payback period of only a few years. However, the final report only includes the unfeasible GSHP, solar thermal and boreholes solution due to space constraints. Details of the ASHP system can be found in the second, unfinished report which includes both solutions.
